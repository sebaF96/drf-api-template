## Template for DRF

This template contains all the boilerplate needed for creating a REST API
using Django and django-rest-framework, including JWT auth using Django default User model.


For this template to work, it needs a **.env** file with the following information:

```
DB_USERNAME=''
DB_PASSWORD=''
DB_NAME=''
DB_PORT=''
DB_ENGINE=''
SECRET_KEY=''
```
